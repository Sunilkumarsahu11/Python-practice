#   Gibonacci series
##  Problem
    write a function which return the nth number from the given gibonacci series gibonacci (n:int, x:int,y:int)

##  Definition 
### A Gibonacci series is defined as :
    F(0) = x where 0 <= x < inf
    F(1) = y where 0 <= y < inf and x > y
    F(n) = F(n-1) - F(n-2) 
    
   Interestingly this series are of fixed numbers and repeat itself after 6n where n >= 0 integer.
   
   For example the first two elements are : [0,1]
   Series : 0 , 1, 1, 0, -1, -1,  0, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 0,...
   
   another example  ; [3,8]
   Series : 3, 8, 5, -3, -8, -5,   3, 8, 5,
